1 - Amazon RDS:

    Amazon RDS is a managed service. This means your database administrator can focus
    on innobvating instead of patching and updating their database and infrastructure.
    
    Amazon RDS is optimized for memory, performance and I/O. With Amazon RDS
    you only pay for what resources you actually consume.
    
    AWS offers serveral familiar database engines. Amazon Auora is AWS's
    lighting fast database solution which is up to 5 times faster than PostgreSQL.
    Aurora databases are highly secure, available and durable.
    
    Amazon RDS provides three templates for your deployment: Production, Dev/Test and Free tier
    Use free-tier if you wish to learn or deploy a quick proof-of-concept. Use the Production
    tier only when deploying a production level system.
    
    Your database identifier is the name you will see when you are searching for 
    your instance in the console. You will be able to connect this database with
    the credentials you provide here.
    
    Amazon RDS supports the most demanding applications. You can choose
    between two SSD-backed storage options: one optimized for high-performance OLTP
    applications, and the other for cost-effective general-purpose use.
    
    The MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and PostgreSQL engines allow you to scale
    uo to 64 TB of storage and SQL Server supports up to 16 TB. Storage
    scaling is on-the-fly with zero downtime.
    
    Amazon RDS makes it easy to contorl network access to your database.
    Amazon RDS also lets you run your database instances in a VPC,
    which enables you to isolate your database instances and to connect
    to your existing IT infrastructure through an industry-standard encrypted
    IPsec VPN.
    
    In order for AWS to succeed provision a RDS database instance for you,
    you must specify an initial database name. If you fail to specify an 
    initial database your instance may still be provisioned but it may not work properly.
